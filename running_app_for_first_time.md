# Running the Code for the First Time

1. Install node if you havent already from this website: https://nodejs.dev/download/. Eden and I did the "LTS Version" and Anna did the current version.

You should then see this come up in the installer screen: 

This package has installed:
	•	Node.js v16.15.0 to /usr/local/bin/node
	•	npm v8.5.5 to /usr/local/bin/npm

Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH by doing `which node` and `node --version`.

2. Install the Expo Client `sudo npm install -g expo-cli`

3. If you get issues, `npm audit fix`

4. If more issues, `npm i --package-lock-only`

5. `npm install`

6. `npm start`

7. Download the "Expo" app on your phone from the app store

8. You should get a QR code that you can scan with your regular camera app.
